    <h2>Croissants Cool facts:</h2>

    <p>
        A symbol of the French breakfast, the croissant actually comes from Austria, probably originating in the 13th Century.

        The name “croissant” actually means “crescent” – the magical pastry that fluffs up while baking.
        <br>
        The name of the world’s first croissant, in Austrian, is kipferl. It has been traced all the way back to 1200, in both simple versions as well as topped with almonds, hazelnuts or fruit.

        The Queen of the French Revolution is famously attributed for the phrase, “Let them eat cake”. But what she really said, when told that the population was in revolt because they had no bread, was, “Let them eat croissant”.

        In the recent hit by Kanye West, “I am God”, he rallies against the long cooking time needed to make a croissant. French boulangers responded by listing the recipe and cooking time needed for making the perfect croissant.

        “Yakitate!!” means, “freshly baked” in Japanese. And one of Japan’s most popular Manga characters has to bake a croissant with 324 layers of dough.
